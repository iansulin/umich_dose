## 1.01. Overview of the DOSE Framework

The **DOSE** framework is a lightweight, fully offline-capable system designed for conducting **Experience Sampling Method (ESM)** and **Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)** studies using the Apple Watch. It enables researchers to deliver brief, time-sensitive survey prompts to participants throughout the day, capturing in-the-moment behaviors, contexts, and psychological states with minimal participant burden. Unlike traditional smartphone-based EMA tools, DOSE leverages the unique affordances of the Apple Watch—ubiquitous presence, haptic feedback, and quick glanceability—to support truly momentary self-report collection in real-world settings.

DOSE is built with **flexibility and configurability in mind**. Researchers can define randomized notification schedules using a window-based system, specify the number of prompts per day, and customize survey expiration logic. The framework includes **five customizable survey interfaces**, each optimized for small-screen interaction: numeric keypad, scribble/dictation, step slider, circular slider, and scrollable list. Each survey is composed of a single question and can be easily configured in the source code. DOSE logs all interactions locally on the device—including notification delivery, opening, and response timestamps—and synchronizes data with Firebase when internet connectivity is available. This architecture ensures robust data capture even in low-connectivity environments, making DOSE particularly suited for ambulatory studies and field-based research.
