## DOSE: A Framework for Apple Watch-Based ESM/EMA & Health Data Collection

**DOSE** is a flexible framework for building your own Apple Watch app for real-time surveys and health data collection (no coding required).

Created for researchers, clinicians, and institutions, DOSE makes it easy to design and deploy wrist-based experience sampling and ecological momentary assessment (ESM/EMA) studies using **Apple Watches**. You can configure when and how prompts appear, what questions are asked, and which health metrics are collected, all through editable setup files.

The app also supports passive data collection through **HealthKit** and syncs both survey responses and health data securely to **Firebase Realtime Database** for easy access and analysis. Whether you're starting a small pilot or managing a large-scale study, DOSE gives you a complete toolkit to launch your own wrist-based research app—without needing to build everything from scratch.

What’s in this repo:
1. **Project files** — A watchOS-based ESM (Experience Sampling Method) data collection app you can customize for your own study.
2. **Step-by-step instructions** — Easy-to-follow guides to build and deploy the watch app through App Store.
3. **Comprehensive documentation** — Covers app features, data types collected, data collection flow, and participant onboarding prodcess.
